// For Coasta, you edit this file and free.h as you wish,
// just make sure these two functions are present. I would
// advise making helper functions that accept void pointers
// and these functions call those funcitons. The reason I'm
// doing this is becasue I realized this makes the caller
// life easier by not having to specify the size of the data
// type.

// Frees <alloc>[i] (0 <= i < <x>) and <alloc>.
void doubleFree(char ** alloc, int x) {

// Frees <alloc>[i][j] (0 <= i < <x>, 0 <= j < <y>) and <alloc>.
void tripleFree(char *** alloc, int x, int y) {
